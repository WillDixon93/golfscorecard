# Golf Scorecard 

The initial objective of this app is to create an aesthetic scorecard which can be used at any course in the UK. This will require finding an open source UK Golf Course database, otherwise I will just create one for my local clubs. 

The aim is for the UI of the scorecard to look like a scorecard you would get at a golf club, and is reactive to your location.
